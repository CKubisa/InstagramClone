I am a senior computer science major at New Paltz. I've taken every cs course at New Paltz except language Processing and projects. The projects I have worked on here are a raspberry pi security device and a unity and a game demo in unity.

I think this course would be useful for me to know how to have sites to host future projects. Also one of the ways most people interact with the internet is through websites so it's important to know how to make and maintain them.
